# Key Design Patterns

## Interface-Based Architecture

The application heavily uses interfaces for extensibility:
- `Model` interface - All AI providers implement this
- `ResponseHandler` interface - Multiple output handlers
- `HistoryRepository` interface - Swappable storage backends
- `EmbeddingsStore` interface - Multiple vector databases
- `ToolModel` interface - Extensible tool system

## Tool Registration Pattern

Tools self-register using init() functions:
```go
func init() {
    Register(&MyTool{})
}
```

This allows automatic discovery without central configuration.

## Mode-Based Tool Filtering

Tools declare their availability (LOCAL or REMOTE), allowing the server to expose only appropriate tools.

## Streaming Architecture

Supports both streaming and non-streaming responses throughout:
- Models handle both via `HandleStreamedLine()` and `HandleBodyBytes()`
- Response handlers support incremental text
- TUI uses channels for async updates

## Multi-Backend Storage

Abstraction layers allow swapping:
- User databases: Single-user vs multi-user SQLite
- Embeddings: SQLite-vec vs DuckDB
- Future: PostgreSQL support

---

# File Organization Best Practices

1. **Model implementations** go in `models/{provider}/`
2. **Tool implementations** go in `tools/` as single files
3. **Data models** stay in `data/`
4. **Business logic** goes in `services/`
5. **UI components** go in `tui/`
6. **Configuration and initialization** in root

This architecture enables:
- Easy addition of new AI models
- Simple tool creation and registration
- Swappable storage backends
- Multiple UI modes from same core
- Clean separation of concerns
