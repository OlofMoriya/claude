# Owl Application Skills & Tools

This document outlines all available skills and tools that the Owl TUI chat application can utilize.

## Overview

Owl is a terminal-based chat application that integrates with multiple AI models and provides a suite of tools for file manipulation, git operations, HTTP requests, and more.

---

## Quick Start & Installation

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.24.0 or higher
- Git (for version control operations)
- API keys for AI models you want to use (Claude, OpenAI, Grok, etc.)

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the project root with your API credentials:

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_claude_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
OWL_LOCAL_DATABASE=owl  # Optional: database name (default: owl)
```

### Building & Running

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <repository>
cd owl
go mod download

# Build the application
go build -o owl

# Run the application
./owl [flags]
```

---

## Command Line Arguments & Usage

### Basic Usage Modes

#### 1. Interactive Prompt Mode (Default)
```bash
# Launch with a direct prompt
./owl -prompt "What is Go?"

# Launch and wait for input
./owl
# Then type your prompt when prompted
```

#### 2. TUI Mode (Terminal User Interface)
```bash
./owl -tui
```
Launch the interactive terminal interface with chat history, conversation management, and context switching. This is the recommended way to use Owl for extended conversations.

**TUI Features:**
- Interactive chat interface
- Conversation history viewing
- Context switching
- Message formatting and markdown support
- Real-time streaming responses

#### 3. Server Mode (HTTP API)
```bash
# Basic server mode
./owl -serve

# With custom port
./owl -serve -port 8080

# With HTTPS enabled
./owl -serve -port 8443 -secure
```
Launches Owl as an HTTP API server for programmatic access.

## Tool Constraints & Best Practices

### File Operations
- Paths must be relative to current directory
- No parent directory references (..) allowed
- Parent directories must exist before creating files in subdirectories

### HTTP Requests
- Headers formatted as semicolon-separated key-value pairs
- Request body typically JSON for POST/PUT/PATCH
- Include proper Content-Type headers

### Image Generation
- Limit to 1-2 images per request (time-intensive)
- Provide detailed, descriptive prompts
- Results saved as PNG files

### Reading Files
- Prefers specific extensions: .go, .md, .tsx, .ts, .csv, .js, .txt, .mod, .cs, .csproj, .gitignore, .jsx, .json
- Avoid overuse to manage token consumption
